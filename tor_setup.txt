1) Ensure Tor is installed/running Properly

    BASH terminal:    
    sudo apt install tor
    sudo service tor start
        
If work correctly, Tor should listening on port 9050 for
SOCKS4/5 connections and on port 9051 for control connections.
   
2) To ensure Tor is configured properly, update the torrc
configuration file, located...
   
    LINUX/UNIX: /etc/tor/torrc
     
    WINDOWS: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\tor\torrc on Windows.

Ensure these lines are in your torrc:

    SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050
    ControlPort 127.0.0.1:9051

3) If connection errors, check for Controller Authentication in the torrc
configuration file. This may occur occur if controller is not authenticated 
properly. Ensure the torrc configuration file has this line:

    CookieAuthentication 1
